# Linux Desktop LLM Apps

![alt text](images/banner.webp)

 This repository is a small gathering of different large language model frontends that are accessible for Linux desktop users. 

 Given that self hosted tools which can run on Linux servers are a much larger list, but which also often serve a different purpose, this list is primarily focused on desktop clients. 

 Exciting new LLM apps are being developed at a papid pace. If you're developing one and would like to add it to the list, please just drop me an email or open a pull request  

## Local LLM Frontends

*GUIs and CLIs for running large language models (LLMs) on Linux.*

---

### GUIs

#### [Anything LLM](https://docs.anythingllm.com/installation-desktop/linux#install-using-the-installer-script)
*Desktop application for working with LLMs.*  

An interesting front end which covers a lot of different bases, including interaction with multiple cloud model providers, built-in RAG, and some voice features.

#### [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
*Discover, download, and run local LLMs.*  

I highly recommend LM Studio as an excellent starting point for anyone looking at hosting models locally on Linux for the first time. A well rounded and versatile tool.

### Voice-Centric Apps

Large language model front ends which emphasize voice features such as seamless speech-to-text, text-to-speech or speech-to-speech/realtime conversation.

#### [PyGPT](https://pygpt.net/)

Very interesting project which has put emphasis on multimodal interaction, an area where many local front ends have struggled to keep up.
